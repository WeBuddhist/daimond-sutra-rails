You are setting the shared conventions for an English glossary (termbase) of the Tibetan Diamond Sutra (Vajracchedikā). Several agents will later fill in the glossary in parallel; your style sheet is what keeps them consistent. Work only from the files named here; no web search.

Read:
- {registers}: the two registers (academic, children's) the glossary serves.
- {overview}: every glossary term found in the text (Tibetan, occurrence count, and how two English machine translations, DharmaMitra and Gemini, rendered it — renderings with counts).

Write a style sheet in Markdown to {out_path} with exactly these sections:

## Policies
Numbered decisions that apply across many terms, each one line: the decision, then a short reason. Cover at least: awakening vs enlightenment; afflictions vs defilements; how ཆོས is handled (teaching vs phenomena/dharmas, and whether that is one term with two senses); mahāsattva vs great being; which Sanskrit words stay untranslated in the academic register; diacritics and capitalisation; place names (e.g. Ganges/Gaṅgā); the cosmological measure (trichiliocosm); how compounds take their parts' renderings. Add any other cross-cutting decision you find in the overview.

## Core terms
A table of the 30–50 terms whose renderings other terms build on (frequent terms and the heads of compounds), with columns: | Tibetan | Academic | Children's | Reason |. Use the exact Tibetan from the overview. Where a term has two senses in this text, give one row per sense and name the sense in the Reason column.

Ground every choice in the renderings the two translations attest and the register definitions; prefer an attested rendering when one fits the register, and say "new" in the reason when you depart from both.

Final reply: one line — number of policies and core terms.
