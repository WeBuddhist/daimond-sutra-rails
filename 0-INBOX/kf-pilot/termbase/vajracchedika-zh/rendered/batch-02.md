You are filling in part of the Chinese (Traditional characters) glossary (termbase) for the Tibetan Diamond Sutra (Vajracchedikā). Other agents are doing the other parts in parallel; consistency comes from the style sheet. Work only from the files named here; no web search.

Read first:
- /Users/tashitsering/Desktop/work/Obsidian/KF-project/daimond-sutra-rails/0-INBOX/kf-pilot/termbase/registers-zh.md: the two Chinese (Traditional characters) registers (academic, children's).
- /Users/tashitsering/Desktop/work/Obsidian/KF-project/daimond-sutra-rails/0-INBOX/kf-pilot/termbase/vajracchedika-zh/style-sheet.md: the shared policies and core-term renderings. FOLLOW IT EXACTLY: a core term gets the style sheet's renderings, and a compound builds on its parts' style-sheet renderings.

Input: /Users/tashitsering/Desktop/work/Obsidian/KF-project/daimond-sutra-rails/0-INBOX/kf-pilot/termbase/vajracchedika-zh/batches/batch-02.json
A JSON list of terms. Each has `term_id`, `bo` (Tibetan), `sanskrit`, `count`, `occurrences`, `senses` (each with `sense`, its `occurrences`, and the approved English renderings `en_academic` / `en_children` — your guide to what the term means in this text), and up to three `examples` (the Tibetan segment `bo`, Kumārajīva's aligned classical Chinese (`kumarajiva`, when aligned) and a Gemini zero-shot modern Chinese line (`gemini_zero_shot`)).

For each term, keep its `senses` EXACTLY as given (same labels, same order, same occurrences) and for each sense give:
- `academic` and `children`: the Chinese (Traditional characters) renderings (head forms, per the registers and the style sheet);
- `basis`: "kumarajiva" if you took Kumārajīva's term, "zero-shot" if the Gemini line's, "style-sheet" if from the style sheet, "english-pivot" if you translated the English rendering, "new" otherwise;
- `reason`: max 20 words (English).
Copy `sanskrit` through unchanged.

Write UTF-8 JSON to: /Users/tashitsering/Desktop/work/Obsidian/KF-project/daimond-sutra-rails/0-INBOX/kf-pilot/termbase/vajracchedika-zh/agents/batch-02.json
{"batch": "batch-02", "terms": [{"term_id": "T001", "bo": "...", "sanskrit": "...", "senses": [{"sense": "<as given>", "occurrences": "<as given>", "academic": "...", "children": "...", "basis": "...", "reason": "..."}]}]}

Every input term must appear exactly once, with `bo` unchanged. Before finishing, run this check, fix every problem, and repeat until it prints OK:

    python3 /Users/tashitsering/Desktop/work/Obsidian/KF-project/daimond-sutra-rails/0-INBOX/kf-pilot/termbase/check.py /Users/tashitsering/Desktop/work/Obsidian/KF-project/daimond-sutra-rails/0-INBOX/kf-pilot/termbase/vajracchedika-zh/batches/batch-02.json /Users/tashitsering/Desktop/work/Obsidian/KF-project/daimond-sutra-rails/0-INBOX/kf-pilot/termbase/vajracchedika-zh/agents/batch-02.json

Final reply: one line — terms done.
